# Gateway OpenAPI Specification

This document contains the [OpenAPI overlay](https://github.com/OAI/Overlay-Specification) for the Gateway AI API. It extends the [AI runner OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker/blob/main/runner/openapi.yaml) from the [livepeer/ai-worker](https://github.com/livepeer/ai-worker) package. This overlay can be used to generate client libraries and API documentation, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date interface for interacting with the Gateway AI services.

## Usage

The Livepeer AI SDKs are generated using the [SpeakEasy](https://www.speakeasy.com/docs) SDK generator. For more information on generating SDKs with this overlay, please refer to the [SpeakEasy overlay documentation](https://www.speakeasy.com/docs/overlays). The SpeakEasy suite, through GitHub Actions, also ensures that the [API documentation](https://github.com/livepeer/docs) is up-to-date and synchronized with the API implementation.
