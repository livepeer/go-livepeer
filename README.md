The Livepeer project aims to deliver a live video-streaming network protocol
that is fully decentralized, highly scalable and crypto-token incentivized to
serve as the live media layer in the decentralized development (Web3) stack.
[Read our documentation](https://docs.livepeer.org/protocol/overview) to learn more about the protocol and its economic incentives.

`go-livepeer` is a Go implementation of the [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org) protocol which powers the Livepeer Network. Specifically, `go-livepeer` contains implementations of Broadcaster, Orchestrator, and Transcoder nodes (roles) in the Livepeer Network ecosystem.
