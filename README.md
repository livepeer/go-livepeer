The Livepeer project aims to deliver a live video streaming network protocol
that is fully decentralized, highly scalable, crypto token incentivized, and
results in a solution which can serve as the live media layer in the
decentralized development (web3) stack. You can learn more about the protocol
and economic incentives by reading
[our docs](https://docs.livepeer.org/protocol/overview).

go-livepeer is a Go implementation of the [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org) protocol which powers the Livepeer Network. Specifically, go-livepeer contains implementations of broadcaster, orchestrator, and transcoder nodes on the Livepeer Network
