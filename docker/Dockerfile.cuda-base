#
# Base CUDA Develop image which contains CUDA SDK libs for the following architectures: linux amd64, linux arm64, windows amd64
#
# To build this image you need the following steps:
# 1. Download NVIDIA CUDA SDK for ARM64, extract, and copy into cuda/arm64/usr/local/cuda/
# 2. Download NVIDIA CUDA SDK for Windows AMD64, extract, and copy npp libs into npp_win/
