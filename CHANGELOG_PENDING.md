# Unreleased Changes

## vX.X

This release includes a new `-hevcDecoding` flag for transcoders to configure HEVC decoding. If the flag is omitted, the default behavior on GPUs is unchanged, which is to auto-detect HEVC decoding support at transcoder start-up. Transcoders can disable HEVC decoding on GPUs if there is an issue with HEVC jobs via `-hevcDecoding=false`. CPU transcoders now have HEVC decoding disabled by default since processing HEVC jobs is CPU-heavy, but this can be enabled by setting the `-hevcDecoding` flag.

The transcoder now support mid-stream input rotations, rather than crashing or outputting cropped video as it did before.
