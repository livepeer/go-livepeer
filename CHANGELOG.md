# Changelog

## v0.5.15

*March 15th 2021*

This release includes an important fix for a bug that could cause transcoding to become stuck for certain corrupt or unsupported source segments. As a result of this bug, some operators saw a high number of sessions in metrics reporting on their orchestrators or transcoders despite receiving a low amount of streams in practice. We strongly recommend that all orchestrator and transcoder operators upgrade to this version as soon as possible to access this bug fix.

Thanks everyone that submitted bug reports and assisted in testing!
