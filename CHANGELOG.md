# Changelog

## v0.5.29

*February 21 2022*

This release is a fast follow release for v0.5.28 with a few bug fixes including a fix for a nil pointer error when parsing block header logs that could cause the node to crash and a fix for displaying the global LPT supply and participation rate in `livepeer_cli`. 

This release also includes a darwin arm64 build and darwin/linux binaries compiled using Go 1.17.6.

### Breaking Changes üö®üö®

- The `segment_transcoded_appeared_total` and `transcode_latency_seconds` metrics are removed because they were tracked per transcoding profile and the node already tracks the overall version of the metrics
- The `upload_time_seconds` and `discovery_errors_toatl` metrics are tracked per orchestrators instead of per stream

## v0.5.28

*February 11th 2022*

This release supports connecting to Arbitrum Mainnet using the `-network arbitrum-one-mainnet` flag after the L1 Ethereum block 14207040 which is the block at which [LIP-73 i.e. the Confluence upgrade](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs/blob/master/LIPs/LIP-73.md#specification) will be activated. Prior to this block, running the node wtih `-network arbitrum-one-mainnet` will result in a startup error so it is recommended to wait until after block 14207040 to run the node with the `-network arbitrum-one-mainnet` flag. **We strongly encourage all node operators to upgrade to this release so they can connect to Arbitrum Mainnet after the LIP-73 block**.

Additional updates in this release include various improvements to compatibility with Arbitrum networks as well as the initial groundwork for enabling H.265/HEVC encoding/decoding and VP8/VP9 decoding jobs on the network.

## v0.5.25

*January 12th 2022*

This release adds support for a new L1 Rinkeby contract deployment used for the [Confluence](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs/blob/master/LIPs/LIP-73.md) testnet. **If you are planning on participating in the testnet you should upgrade to this release.** This release does not contain any updates for mainnet.

### Breaking Changes üö®üö®

- The node will no longer connect with the old L1 Rinkeby contract deployment when the `-network rinkeby` flag is used. Instead the node will connect to the new L1 Rinkeby contract deployment when the `-network rinkeby` flag is used using a new hardcoded Controller contract address at [0x9a9827455911a858E55f07911904fACC0D66027E](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x9a9827455911a858E55f07911904fACC0D66027E).

#### General

- [#2177](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/pull/2177) Update hardcoded Rinkeby Eth Controller Address (@leszko)

## v0.5.24

*January 5th 2022*

This is a fast follow patch release for v0.5.24 to fix a bug that caused orchestrators to return errors right after a transaction is submitted resulting in the previously active streams to be re-routed from the orchestrators. **If you are running an orchestrator you should upgrade to this release as soon as possible.**

In order to fix this bug, the feature from v0.5.24 that set the `maxFeePerGas` of transactions to `-maxGasPrice` is temporarily disabled and will be re-enabled in the next release. The node will continue not submitting transactions if the current expected gas price for a transaction exceeds `-maxGasPrice`, but due to the disabling of the aforementioned feature, it is possible for a transaction to be mined at a gas price higher than `-maxGasPrice` if the gas price increases quickly after the node performs its `-maxGasPrice` check. The next release will ensure that a transaction cannot be mined at a gas price higher than `-maxGasPrice`.

## v0.5.23

*December 20th 2021*

This release includes an important fix for a memory leak that can be triggered when using the CUDA MPEG-7 video signature capability (when using a Nvidia GPU), which is used for [fast verification](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/transcoding-verification-improvements-fast-full-verification/1499), for orchestrators/transcoders. **If you are running an orchestrator or transcoder you should upgrade to this release as soon as possible.**

Additional highlights of this release:

- Support for running fast verification on broadcasters
- Support for configuring `livepeer` using a file. See [the docs](https://livepeer.org/docs/installation/configuring-livepeer) for instructions on using a configuration file
- An improvement to the failover behavior in split orchestrator + transcoder setups in the scenario where a transcoder crashes
- Ensure that the the fee per gas for a transaction never exceeds the value set for `-maxGasPrice`

## v0.5.22

*October 28 2021*

This release includes an important MPEG-7 video signature capability fix, which is used for [fast verification](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/transcoding-verification-improvements-fast-full-verification/1499), for orchestrators/transcoders running on Windows. **If you are running an orchestrator or transcoder on Windows you should upgrade to this release as soon as possible.**

Additional highlights of this release:

- Support for EIP-1559 (otherwise known as type 2) Ethereum transactions which results in more predictable transaction confirmation times, reduces the chance of stuck pending transactions and avoids overpaying in gas fees. If you are interested in additional details on the implications of EIP-1559 transactions refer to this [resource](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/1559-resources).
- An improvement in ticket parameter generation for orchestrators to prevent short lived gas price spikes on the Ethereum network from disrupting streams.
- The node will automatically detect if the GPU enters an unrecoverable state and crash. The reason for crashing upon detecting an unrecoverable GPU state is that no transcoding will
be possible in this scenario until the node is restarted. We recommend node operators to setup a process for monitoring if their node is still up and starting the node if it has crashed. For reference, a bash script similar to [this one](https://gist.github.com/jailuthra/03c3d65d0bbff457cae8f9a14b4c04b7) can be used to automate restarts of the node in the event of a crash.

## v0.5.21

*September 29 2021*

This release includes a new orchestrator/transcoder MPEG-7 video signature capability which is required for broadcasters to run transcoding verification. The MPEG-7 video signatures are used as perceptual hashes in a "fast verification" algorithm that is described in the [Fast and Full Transcoding Verification design](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/transcoding-verification-improvements-fast-full-verification/1499). If a CPU is used for transcoding, the video signature computation will occur on the CPU. If a GPU is used for transcoding (i.e. the `-nvidia` flag is used), the video signature computation will occur on the GPU. Orchestrators and transcoders should upgrade to this release as soon as possible to ensure that they will be able to continue serving broadcasters that run fast verification (the complete broadcaster implementation will be shipped at a later date).

Orchestrators and transcoders should also make note of the breaking change in this release that drops support for Nvidia GPUs from the Kepler series.

Thanks to everyone that submitted bug reports and assisted in testing!

### Breaking Changes üö®üö®

- [#2027](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/pull/2027) Nvidia GPUs belonging to the Kepler series (GeForce 600, 700 series) and older, are no longer supported by go-livepeer. Cuda 11 is needed for newer GPUs, which [only supports the Maxwell series](https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/) or newer.

## v0.5.20

*September 10 2021*

This release includes a few important bug fixes including:

- A fix for winning tickets incorrectly being marked as redeemed in the node's database even though they have not been redeemed yet
- A fix for node crashes due to the submission of a replacement transaction when a max gas price configured
- A fix for increased gas usage of reward transactions if an orchestrator did not receive stake updates in the previous round (via a reward call or delegation)

Additionally, this release includes a new `-autoAdjustPrice` flag that allows orchestrators to enable/disable automatic price adjustments based on the overhead for ticket redemption (which is determined by the current ETH gas price). Orchestrators can disable automatic price adjustments by setting `-autoAdjustPrice=false` (default is true) to ensure that they advertise a constant price to broadcasters avoiding the scenario where they lose all jobs due to a gas price spike that causes their advertised price to exceed the max price set by broadcasters. If orchestrators disable automatic price adjustments then it is recommended to also use the `-maxGasPrice` flag to set a maximum gas price for transactions to wait to redeem tickets during lower gas prices periods.

## v0.5.19

*August 10 2021*

This release includes another gas price monitoring fix to address additional cases where Ethereum JSON-RPC providers occassionally return really low gas prices for the `eth_gasPrice` RPC call, automatic replacements for pending transactions that timeout, fixes for broadcaster stream recording, support for downloading stream recordings as mp4 files as well as variety of other bug fixes and enhancements.

In addition to the gas price monitoring fix and support for automatic replacements for pending transactions that timeout, a few additional configuration options are introduced to give node operators more control over gas prices and transactions:

- `-maxTransactionReplacements <INTEGER>` can be used to specify the max number of times to replace a pending transaction that times out. The default value is 1.
- `-txTimeout <DURATION>` can be used to specify the timeout duration for a pending transaction after which a replacement transaction would be submitted. The default value is 5m.
- `-minGasPrice <INTEGER>` can be used to specify the minimum gas price (in wei) to use for transactions. The default is 1 gwei on mainnet.

More information about these new flags is accessible via `livepeer -help`.

The default value for the `-maxTicketEV` flag for broadcasters has been updated to 3000 gwei based on the default value of 1000 gwei for the `-ticketEV` flag for orchestrators which is safer for broadcasters. For more information on these default values, refer to the [payment docs for video developers](https://livepeer.org/docs/video-developers/core-concepts/payments) and the [payment docs for video miners](https://livepeer.org/docs/video-miners/core-concepts/payments).

An experimental version of a deep neural network (DNN) based scene classification capability is mentioned in the changelog, but please note that while this is the first step towards enabling this capability on the network for video miners, this feature is **NOT** yet usable on the network today and is undergoing rapid development.

## v0.5.18

*May 18 2021*

This release includes an important gas price monitoring fix that addresses cases where Ethereum JSON-RPC providers occassionally return really low gas prices for the `eth_gasPrice` RPC call, reductions in the gas cost for staking actions (under certain circumstances) using `livepeer_cli`  and improvements to split orchestrator and transcoder setups that help remote transcoders retain streams. We strongly recommend all orchestrator and transcoder operators to upgrade to this version as soon as possible to access this latest set of bug fixes and improvements.

Thanks to everyone that submitted bug reports and assisted in testing!

## v0.5.15

*March 15th 2021*

This release includes an important fix for a bug that could cause transcoding to become stuck for certain corrupt or unsupported source segments. As a result of this bug, some operators saw a high number of sessions in metrics reporting on their orchestrators or transcoders despite receiving a low amount of streams in practice. We strongly recommend that all orchestrator and transcoder operators upgrade to this version as soon as possible to access this bug fix.

Thanks everyone that submitted bug reports and assisted in testing!
