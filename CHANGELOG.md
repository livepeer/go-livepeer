# Changelog

## v0.5.18

*May 18 2021*

This release includes an important gas price monitoring fix that addresses cases where Ethereum JSON-RPC providers occassionally return really low gas prices for the `eth_gasPrice` RPC call, reductions in the gas cost for staking actions (under certain circumstances) using `livepeer_cli`  and improvements to split orchestrator and transcoder setups that help remote transcoders retain streams. We strongly recommend all orchestrator and transcoder operators to upgrade to this version as soon as possible to access this latest set of bug fixes and improvements.

Thanks to everyone that submitted bug reports and assisted in testing!

### Breaking Changes üö®üö®

- Payment/ticket metrics are no longer recorded with high cardinality keys (i.e. recipient, manifestID) which means those labels will no longer be available when using a monitoring system such as Prometheus

## v0.5.15

*March 15th 2021*

This release includes an important fix for a bug that could cause transcoding to become stuck for certain corrupt or unsupported source segments. As a result of this bug, some operators saw a high number of sessions in metrics reporting on their orchestrators or transcoders despite receiving a low amount of streams in practice. We strongly recommend that all orchestrator and transcoder operators upgrade to this version as soon as possible to access this bug fix.

Thanks everyone that submitted bug reports and assisted in testing!
