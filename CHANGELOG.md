# Changelog

## v0.5.22

*October 28 2021*

This release includes an important MPEG-7 video signature capability fix, which is used for [fast verification](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/transcoding-verification-improvements-fast-full-verification/1499), for orchestrators/transcoders running on Windows. **If you are running an orchestrator or transcoder on Windows you should upgrade to this release as soon as possible.**

Additional highlights of this release:

- Support for EIP-1559 (otherwise known as type 2) Ethereum transactions which results in more predictable transaction confirmation times, reduces the chance of stuck pending transactions and avoids overpaying in gas fees. If you are interested in additional details on the implications of EIP-1559 transactions refer to this [resource](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/1559-resources).
- An improvement in ticket parameter generation for orchestrators to prevent short lived gas price spikes on the Ethereum network from disrupting streams.
- The node will automatically detect if the GPU enters an unrecoverable state and crash. The reason for crashing upon detecting an unrecoverable GPU state is that no transcoding will
be possible in this scenario until the node is restarted. We recommend node operators to setup a process for monitoring if their node is still up and starting the node if it has crashed. For reference, a bash script similar to [this one](https://gist.github.com/jailuthra/03c3d65d0bbff457cae8f9a14b4c04b7) can be used to automate restarts of the node in the event of a crash.

Thanks to everyone that submitted bug reports and assisted in testing!

## v0.5.21

*September 29 2021*

This release includes a new orchestrator/transcoder MPEG-7 video signature capability which is required for broadcasters to run transcoding verification. The MPEG-7 video signatures are used as perceptual hashes in a "fast verification" algorithm that is described in the [Fast and Full Transcoding Verification design](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/transcoding-verification-improvements-fast-full-verification/1499). If a CPU is used for transcoding, the video signature computation will occur on the CPU. If a GPU is used for transcoding (i.e. the `-nvidia` flag is used), the video signature computation will occur on the GPU. Orchestrators and transcoders should upgrade to this release as soon as possible to ensure that they will be able to continue serving broadcasters that run fast verification (the complete broadcaster implementation will be shipped at a later date).

Orchestrators and transcoders should also make note of the breaking change in this release that drops support for Nvidia GPUs from the Kepler series.

Thanks to everyone that submitted bug reports and assisted in testing!

### Breaking Changes üö®üö®

- [#2027](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/pull/2027) Nvidia GPUs belonging to the Kepler series (GeForce 600, 700 series) and older, are no longer supported by go-livepeer. Cuda 11 is needed for newer GPUs, which [only supports the Maxwell series](https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/) or newer.

## v0.5.20

*September 10 2021*

This release includes a few important bug fixes including:

- A fix for winning tickets incorrectly being marked as redeemed in the node's database even though they have not been redeemed yet
- A fix for node crashes due to the submission of a replacement transaction when a max gas price configured
- A fix for increased gas usage of reward transactions if an orchestrator did not receive stake updates in the previous round (via a reward call or delegation)

Additionally, this release includes a new `-autoAdjustPrice` flag that allows orchestrators to enable/disable automatic price adjustments based on the overhead for ticket redemption (which is determined by the current ETH gas price). Orchestrators can disable automatic price adjustments by setting `-autoAdjustPrice=false` (default is true) to ensure that they advertise a constant price to broadcasters avoiding the scenario where they lose all jobs due to a gas price spike that causes their advertised price to exceed the max price set by broadcasters. If orchestrators disable automatic price adjustments then it is recommended to also use the `-maxGasPrice` flag to set a maximum gas price for transactions to wait to redeem tickets during lower gas prices periods.

Thanks to everyone that submitted bug reports and assisted in testing!

## v0.5.19

*August 10 2021*

This release includes another gas price monitoring fix to address additional cases where Ethereum JSON-RPC providers occassionally return really low gas prices for the `eth_gasPrice` RPC call, automatic replacements for pending transactions that timeout, fixes for broadcaster stream recording, support for downloading stream recordings as mp4 files as well as variety of other bug fixes and enhancements.

In addition to the gas price monitoring fix and support for automatic replacements for pending transactions that timeout, a few additional configuration options are introduced to give node operators more control over gas prices and transactions:

- `-maxTransactionReplacements <INTEGER>` can be used to specify the max number of times to replace a pending transaction that times out. The default value is 1.
- `-txTimeout <DURATION>` can be used to specify the timeout duration for a pending transaction after which a replacement transaction would be submitted. The default value is 5m.
- `-minGasPrice <INTEGER>` can be used to specify the minimum gas price (in wei) to use for transactions. The default is 1 gwei on mainnet.

More information about these new flags is accessible via `livepeer -help`.

The default value for the `-maxTicketEV` flag for broadcasters has been updated to 3000 gwei based on the default value of 1000 gwei for the `-ticketEV` flag for orchestrators which is safer for broadcasters. For more information on these default values, refer to the [payment docs for video developers](https://livepeer.org/docs/video-developers/core-concepts/payments) and the [payment docs for video miners](https://livepeer.org/docs/video-miners/core-concepts/payments).

An experimental version of a deep neural network (DNN) based scene classification capability is mentioned in the changelog, but please note that while this is the first step towards enabling this capability on the network for video miners, this feature is **NOT** yet usable on the network today and is undergoing rapid development.

## v0.5.18
