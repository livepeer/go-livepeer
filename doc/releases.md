# go-livepeer release process

### Branches

We presently use three branches for go-livepeer releases.

#### master

This branch is compatible with contracts on Rinkeby and mainnet. Code committed to this branch MUST NOT break contract compatibility on Rinkeby or mainnet.

Releases are cut from this branch. All releases should have a tag of the form `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

Built in CI with `-tags mainnet` so resulting binaries can connect to private networks, Rinkeby and mainnet. Published to Docker Hub as `livepeer/go-livepeer:master` and e.g. `livepeer/go-livepeer:0.5.3`.

#### rinkeby

This branch is compatible with contracts on Rinkeby, but may be incompatible with contracts on mainnet. Code committed to this branch MUST NOT break contract compatibility on Rinkeby, but may break contract compatibility on mainnet. This branch can be merged into `master` when it is compatible with contracts on mainnet.

Built in CI with `-tags rinkeby` so resulting binaries can connect to private networks or Rinkeby. Published to Docker Hub as `livepeer/go-livepeer:rinkeby`.

#### dev 

This branch may be incompatible with contracts on Rinkeby and mainnet. Code committed to this branch can break contract compatibility with Rinkeby or mainnet. This branch can be merged into `rinkeby` when it becomes compatible with contracts on Rinkeby.

Built in CI with `-tags dev` so resulting binaries can only connect to private networks. Published to DockerHub as `livepeer/go-livepeer:dev`.

### Contract Compatible Changes

If changes are compatible with contracts on Rinkeby and mainnet then they can be committed directly to the `master` branch.

### Contract Incompatible Changes

Suppose certain changes depend on a new contract that has not been deployed on Rinkeby or mainnet yet or a contract upgrade that has not been executed on Rinkeby or mainnet yet. The steps to land these changes on the `master` branch would be:

1. Deploy the contract(s) on a private network
2. Test the changes on the private network
3. Merge the PR(s) into `dev`
4. Deploy/upgrade the contract(s) on Rinkeby
5. Merge `dev` into `rinkeby` via PR
6. Test the changes on Rinkeby
7. Deploy/upgrade the contract(s) on mainnet
8. Merge `rinkeby` into `master` via PR

Note that step 3 and on do not need to be executed after every single PR merge in `dev`. Multiple PRs can be merged to `dev` before executing step 3 and on. 

### Release flow

Once all planned code updates are merged into `master`, we use the release candidate binaries built by CI for internal testing on mainnet. During this stage, we

1. Roll out the binaries to internal mainnet infrastructure
2. Check that user facing bugs described in closed bug reports cannot be reproduced
3. Check that user facing features are working as expected
4. Run stream tests that involve sending/monitoring streams sent into broadcasters that are then routed to one or many orchestrators

The goals of this stage are:

1. Test the release candidate on internal infrastructure that can be easily monitored
2. Make sure that code updates did not introduce any obvious regressions
3. Perform manual QA for user facing changes

Once we complete this stage, we prepare a mainnet release.

### Cutting a mainnet release of go-livepeer

First, make the release commit on a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b release-0.5.2 
echo -n '0.5.2' > VERSION
git commit -am 'release v0.5.2'
git push -u origin release-0.5.2
```

Merge the release commit into `master` via PR. Then, push the release tag up.

```bash
git checkout master
git tag v0.5.2
git push origin v0.5.2
```
